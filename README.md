RegOnline Event Organizer Mobile Tools
=========================================================================================

Introduction
-------------------

This is a full working example of the RegOnline Organizer Tools mobile application.  The application 
is all HTML and JavaScript based and uses the RegOnline API (http://www.regonline.com/api) for the 
backend data access via JSONP.  The application is based on the Sencha Touch JavaScript 
framework (http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) and uses additional external tools 
such as Google Charts and jQuery. 
	
Requirements
------------------------------------

The Sencha Touch framework currently only supports [WebKit] based browsers such as Chrome and 
Safari.  These are the default browsers on all iPhones and Android devices so most mobile users 
will be able to access this site.

Usage
--------------------------------

This application will run without a web server and on any platform. In order to run this, clone 
the repository to your local computer and open the index.htm file with a [WebKit] based browser.
